Mick & Cory

Cory: Uhhh hey, umm Mick, it, it looks like there's trouble out there again.

Mick: What is it this time Cory? Another, Another situation for me to get, get involved in for the enjoyment of IDIOTS? Is it star trek again? I mean, I just rant about how superior I am. Who would relate to that?

Cory: I, uh, I don't know Mick.

Mick: That was a RHETORICAL QUESTION CORRRYYYYY, It's so obvious.

Cory: haha yeah, I know, so obvious. So uh uh Mick what dimension are we off to? W-w-whatís the plan?

Mick: Plans are stupid C-Cory!  the universe is too messy and random to have plans, you just go with the flow, ride the wave, donít rock the boat, follow th Ö
Cory: Yeh I GET IT Mick, Jeez!

Mick: oh! Before I forget, Cory, weíre going to J-321, thereís an inhabited planet over there I use it for stashing my crystals. Here, put put this on C-Cory.

Cory: W-what is it Mick? Is it for protection against some weird alien radiation, or or to stay invisible, hide our brain waves or something?

Mick: Itís to stay dry Cory, it always rains over there and itís too windy for an umbrella. Donít worry Cory, our work is underground. Now hurry up, I donít have all day!

A few moments later…

Cory: Eh… So are we at the place? J-321??? This place seems quite odd; and where are your crystals?

Mick: Oh shoot I think we came to a wrong place. This is definitely not the place I was telling you about. It is supposed to be a stable planet not messed up like this!

Cory: W-what? Are you serious Mick? You know what we are supposed to do about this right? Tell me you know what you are doing! Oh my gosh, did you hear that? Something is approaching!!

Mick: THIS IS NOT THE PLACE I WAS TALKING ABOUT. Let’s get out of here immediately! Get back in to the DeLorean!
